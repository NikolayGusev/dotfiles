## Open links in new and in same tabs

- Currently I see no way to open new page in same tab relyably, it just works like it wants to.
  - There's a way to predictably open in a new tab tho
    - use F to trigger links
      - this also switches to the new tab immediately
    - or
    - use CAPITAL letters to specify link name to navigate to

## Anki
- v c to enter caret mode
