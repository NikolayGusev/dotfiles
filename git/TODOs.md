# Lazygit + vscode
- Create a custom command that selects all the commits from current branch so I can view the diff easily what was changed in entire PR.
    - It won't have that nice feature from gitgraph where you can mark files as viewed during this local review?
- Cannot move commit around with ctrl+j/k because those are already occupied by move to the window above/below in vscode.
- create PR for bitbucket at work

## Anki
- How to check the latest branches I have? 
    - Go to magit and use "bl" to see local branches (sorted by last commit date desc).
- Move commits around with lazygit
- Amend old commit with some other code.
