# General
* Nvim as default text editor in windows
* Consume and learn - https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim
* check fugitive and gv.vim - is it usable with vscode?
* replace inside/around args shouldn't jump around to replace unknown something else for hard cases like import {a,b,c} from '...'

# NON-CRUCIAL TODOS 

* https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-jump.md
* some snippets for react comp+props, function, etc would be nice

* Multi cursor - see if this is required. https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi

# Cleanup

** leap f replacement - didn't work properly 16/10/2022
** function text object
** tab out of arguments - https://github.com/abecodes/tabout.nvim


## Tree sitter stuff 
* https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects
* Tree sitter requires c compiler https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter
* abecodes/tabout.nvim - exit context "({ etc faster
* nvim-trevJ.lua - anti-<S-J>


# ANKI

* ANKI iv, av for camelCase intermediate-word motion
* ANKI sandwich surrounding function csf, ysiwf, etc
* ANKI sandwich 2ysa" to surround with two surroundings
* ANKI sandwich i, f, t objects
* ANKI cin<surrounding>, cil<surrounding> to change inside next/prev surrounding (or another op)
* ANKI change visual selection side - o
* ANKI entire buffer selector
* ANKI entire visible screen selector
* ANKI replace <leader>s, <leader><leader>ss, etc
* ANKI Y to yank to the end anki card
* ANKI crs, cru commands.
* * Want to turn fooBar into foo_bar? Press crs (coerce to snake_case). MixedCase (crm), camelCase (crc), snake_case (crs), UPPER_CASE (cru), dash-case (cr-), dot.case (cr.), space case (cr<space>), and Title Case (crt) are all just 3 keystrokes away.
* ANKI Abolish docs.
* ANKI Abolish - %S instead of %S for case insensitive replace.
* ANKI "vaBVd" to delete function to anki cards
* ANKI alt+kj to move lines

# Strategic 

* switch to lua and lazy.nvim - https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-structuring-your-plugins
