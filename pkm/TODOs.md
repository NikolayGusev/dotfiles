## Features I need

### AutoCommit breaks olds files
- Disallow to delete files in autocommits
- Or commit manually

### Navigation

- Go to today
- Go to any day
- Go to note by name
- Go to note by link

### MOC

- Should be able to create MOC trees
- Consider support for multiples of those

### Accessibility

- Ideally should be accessible from neovim/vscode directly

## LogSeq

- Try this
  - https://github.com/vipzhicheng/logseq-plugin-vim-shortcuts
- Proper MOC structure at work and at home

## NVim

- check this out https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim
  - problems
    - doesn't work well in vscode because it opens its own windows and uses telescope
