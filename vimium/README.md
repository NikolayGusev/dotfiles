## How to copy to work machine?

To copy to work machine I have to copy the whole config and apply it.
_But_ this doesn't work for the search engines, so those I have to copy from non-working machine manually. To do so:

- Open vimium settings on local machine
- Copy on local machine
- Open vimium settings on remote machine
- Paste into the remote machine
